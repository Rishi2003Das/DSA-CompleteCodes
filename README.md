Introduction
This repository is designed to help you enhance your understanding of data structures and algorithms through practical implementation in Java. Whether you are preparing for coding interviews, academic exams, or just improving your problem-solving skills, these implementations will be a valuable resource.

Topics Covered
The repository includes solutions for problems in the following areas:

Dynamic Programming: Optimized solutions using memoization and tabulation techniques.
Tries: Efficient data retrieval using prefix trees.
Arrays: Manipulation and algorithms involving linear data structures.
HashMap: Efficient key-value pair management and hashing techniques.
Heaps: Implementation of priority queues and heap-based algorithms.
Stacks: LIFO data structure applications.
Queues: FIFO data structure applications.
LinkedLists: Singly and doubly linked list operations.
